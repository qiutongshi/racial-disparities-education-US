Directions: 
1. Obtain data, by race, on HS graduation rate, mean SAT scores, mean AP scores, and percent chronic absenteeism
2. Clean and organize data to only include mean total scores, percentages, and rates
3. Put percentages and rates in decimal format
4. Separate hs grad rate, mean SAT score, mean AP score, and percent chronic absenteeism by state, each state new sheet
5. Set up 3-cluster analysis for above variables by race for each state
6. Create columns for and calculate z scores (using =STANDARDIZE) for hs grad rate, mean SAT score, mean AP score, and percent chronic absenteeism
7. Create theoretical anchors and use vlookup (=VLOOKUP) for race and z scores
8. Calculate minimum distance^2 for each anchor using (=SUMXMY2)
9. Calculate minimum distance^2 for each race using (=MIN)
10. Figure out which race matches with which anchor using (=MATCH) function
11. Sum minimum distance^2 for each race using (=SUM)
12. Using excel solver, perform 3-cluster analysis
