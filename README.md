# Racial Disparities and Differences in Education Metrics Across 4 US States

## Background
In every major American metropolitan area, including many of those that have prospered most since the 2008 financial crash, huge gaps still separate white people and racial minorities—not only in terms of average hourly wages, but in terms of educational attainment as well. According to [Sarah Treuhaft,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/us-cities-massive-wealth-and-education-gaps/614491/) the vice president of research at PolicyLink, an Oakland-based research-and-advocacy group: “No place is actually doing well. Even the best performers have racial inequities that are unconscionable…”. This indicates that economic growth is not enough and that racial inequities are still prevalent across the country. Prosperous areas are not doing their part in sharing that prosperity across the population. 
As a matter of fact, the education gap between white and nonwhite adults tends to be wider in areas that are thriving than in those that are struggling, largely because many more white people in prosperous states hold degrees. In many states, high-paying information-age jobs are mostly taken by white people, widening the gap even further. Pastor says the performance of the leading information-economy areas, including powerhouses such as Massachusetts and New York, signals a departure from the urban experience of the previous few decades. Through the late 20th century and into the early 21st, overall economic growth was greatest in the metro areas that did best on measures of racial inclusion. This no longer appears to be the case. 
This project will explore the racial disparities regarding education in states covering different regions in the United States. The states include California, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Illinois. The chosen states are located in different regions within the United States, and thus they have different racial breakdown and major industries. Ideally, after comparing and contrasting the different academic performances among the states, we can identify ways in which racial disparities can be eliminated in K-12 and college education, which are considered to be the foundation of social and personal prosperity. 

## Business Question
How do educational characteristics differ by race in the U.S.?

## Data Question
What are the similarities and differences between racial disparities in education between Florida, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and what are the possible reasons behind these disparities?
