# Racial Disparities and Differences in Education Metrics Across 4 US States

## Background
In every major American metropolitan area, there are still huge gaps separating white people and racial minorities. This includes gaps not only in average hourly wages, but also in educational attainment. According to [Sarah Treuhaft,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/us-cities-massive-wealth-and-education-gaps/614491/) a VP at PolicyLink, a research group based in Oakland, CA: “No place is actually doing well. Even the best performers have racial inequities that are unconscionable…”. This indicates that economic growth is not enough and that racial inequities are still prevalent across the country. Prosperous areas are not doing their part in sharing that prosperity across the population. 

The education gap between white and nonwhite adults tends to be wider in areas that are thriving than in those that are struggling, largely because many more white people in thriving states hold degrees. In many states, information-age jobs that are high paying and dependent on human capital are held mostly by white people, widening the gap even further. [Manuel Pastor](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/us-cities-massive-wealth-and-education-gaps/614491/) says the performance of important areas in the economy, including Massachusetts and New York, shows a change in  the urban experience of the past. Overall economic growth was greatest in the metro areas that did best on measures of racial inclusion during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. However, this actually no longer appears to be the case. 

This project will explore the racial disparities regarding education in states covering different regions in the United States. The states include California, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Illinois. The chosen states are located in different regions within the United States, and thus they have different racial breakdown and major industries. Ideally, after comparing and contrasting the different academic performances among the states, we can identify ways in which racial disparities can be eliminated in K-12 and college education, which are considered to be the foundation of social and personal prosperity. 

We chose to look at racial differences in education across states in the US given the rising racial tensions going on in the country right now. We think it is very important that racial disparities in education be addressed and discussed so that comprehensive and all-encompassing policy action can be taken to direct resources where they are needed most. 

## Business Question
How do educational characteristics differ by race in the U.S.?

## Data Question
What are the similarities and differences between racial disparities in education between Florida, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and what are the possible reasons behind these disparities?
